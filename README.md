# Digital Living Standards repository

This repository contains everything we need to standardize the Digital Living
LifeEngine APIs.

The Digital Living core ontology can be found as a JSON-LD
ontology file under [Ontology/dli.jsonld](Ontology/dli.jsonld).

The HTML version of the ontology documentation is hosted at our 
[Github Pages](https://standards.lifeengine.io/)

_Please note that this repository is under active development, and the IRIs
and URIs in the ontology files are subject to change at any time._
